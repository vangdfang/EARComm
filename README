EARComm - Emergency Alert Radio Tool

This is a project long in the works--but finally at a point where I am
happy to release it.  It's still a bit unstable, and the only tested
hardware is the WX-EAR.  I do not have an FM EAR or FM EAR (rev 2), so
stubs for their functionality are included, but not finished.  If you
have one of these models and would like to help, please feel free to
contact me.

Note: currently, this application depends on LibSerial.  This means it
should be portable to any POSIX operating system, but it will NOT be
portable to Windows.  This may change in the future, but LibSerial does
make some of the serial access pleasant.  Serial device names are also
hard-coded for now, though this will change very soon.

Using the application should be simple: qmake, make, ./EARComm.  Currently
I do not have an install feature, and it expects the data files for FIPS
and event codes to be present in the current directory.  Consider this a
known bug.

If you have any requests, please don't hesitate to contact me.
